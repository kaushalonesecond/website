    <h1>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</h1><br>
    <img src="https://www.leaders21.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1108-scaled.jpg" alt="" height="420"><br>
    <p>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey is a guide to personal and professional effectiveness
        through principle-centered living. The book presents seven habits that help individuals move from dependence to
        independence and then to interdependence. The first three habits—Be Proactive, Begin with the End in Mind, and
        Put First Things First—focus on self-mastery and personal responsibility. The next three—Think Win-Win, Seek
        First to Understand, Then to Be Understood, and Synergize—emphasize effective relationships and collaboration.
        The final habit, Sharpen the Saw, encourages continuous renewal and self-care across physical, mental,
        emotional, and spiritual dimensions. Together, these habits foster a balanced, purposeful, and productive life.
