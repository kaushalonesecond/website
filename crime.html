    <h1>Crime and Punishment</h1><br>
    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71O2XIytdqL.jpg" alt="" height="420"><br>
    <p>Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky is a psychological novel that explores guilt, morality, and redemption.
        It follows Rodion Raskolnikov, a poor ex-student in St. Petersburg who believes he is intellectually superior
        and therefore justified in committing a crime for the greater good. Acting on this belief, he murders a
        pawnbroker, believing he can use the money for noble purposes. However, the act plunges him into intense
        psychological torment and paranoia. As he interacts with other characters—like the virtuous Sonia, a destitute
        young woman who becomes his confidante—Raskolnikov struggles with his conscience and the consequences of his
        actions. The novel explores themes of justice, suffering, and the possibility of redemption through suffering.
        Ultimately, Raskolnikov confesses and is sentenced to a Siberian prison, where he begins a slow path toward
        spiritual awakening. Through Raskolnikov’s journey, Dostoevsky delves deeply into the human soul, questioning
        whether true morality can exist without faith or compassion.</p>
