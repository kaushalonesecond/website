    <h1>Atomic Habits</h1><br>

    <p>Atomic Habits by James Clear is a practical guide to building good habits, breaking bad ones, and mastering the
        tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results. The central idea is that small, consistent changes—atomic
        habits—compound over time to create significant improvements. Clear outlines a four-step model of habit
        formation: Cue, Craving, Response, and Reward, and provides a framework called the Four Laws of Behavior Change
        to shape habits effectively: Make it Obvious, Make it Attractive, Make it Easy, and Make it Satisfying. He
        emphasizes the power of focusing on systems rather than goals and encourages readers to build an identity around
        the kind of person they want to become. By aligning daily actions with long-term aspirations, anyone can
        transform their habits and, ultimately, their life.</p>
