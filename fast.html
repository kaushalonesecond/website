    <p>Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman explores how our minds operate using two distinct systems of thinking.
        System 1 is fast, automatic, and intuitive—it helps us make quick judgments and decisions with little effort.
        System 2 is slow, deliberate, and analytical—it's used for complex thinking and problem-solving. While System 1
        is efficient, it often leads to cognitive biases and errors in judgment. Kahneman explains various psychological
        phenomena like the anchoring effect, availability heuristic, and loss aversion, showing how they impact our
        decisions in everyday life, often without us realizing. The book highlights the limitations of human reasoning,
        the influence of emotions, and the importance of recognizing when to slow down and engage System 2. Ultimately,
        it offers valuable insights into how we think and how to make better decisions by understanding our cognitive
        tendencies.</p>
